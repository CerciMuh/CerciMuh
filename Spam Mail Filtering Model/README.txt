Overview
This project implements an Email Spam Filter using the Naïve Bayes algorithm in Python. The filter classifies emails as either "spam" or "ham" based on their content, employing fundamental concepts of machine learning and natural language processing.

Features
Machine Learning Model: Trained a Naïve Bayes classifier to classify emails effectively.
Bayes' Theorem: Applied to compute the probability of messages being spam based on word occurrences.
